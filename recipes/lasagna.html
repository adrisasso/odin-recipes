  <h4>This Lasagna Recipe is easy to make with a creamy ricotta cheese mixture, savory meat sauce, and mozzarella cheese. BONUS: it’s make-ahead and freezer-friendly!</h4>
  <p>This recipe has simple ingredients but tons of flavor with a creamy ricotta mixture, savory meat sauce, and lots of mozzarella cheese. </p>
  <p>This is a great freezer meal, make-ahead recipe, and leftovers freeze and reheat super well. </p>
  <h3>ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>15 oz. ricotta cheese, 2 cups</li>
    <li>1 large egg</li>
    <li>2 cups mozzarella cheese</li>
    <li>¾ cup Parmesan cheese, freshly grated</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons Italian seasoning</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>¼ tsp pepper</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    <li>1 yellow onion, finely diced</li>
    <li>¾ lb. ground beef</li>
    <li>¾ lb. ground Italian sausage</li>
    <li>3 cloves garlic</li>
    <li>½ cup chicken broth</li>
    <li>40 oz. marinara sauce</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon hot sauce</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
    <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
    <li>2.5 cups mozzarella cheese</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Combine the cheese filling ingredients in a medium bowl and set aside. Measure out remaining ingredients.</li>
    <li>Heat olive oil over medium heat and add the diced onions. Let them soften for 10 minutes. (This allows them to release a little sugar which is a nice offset to the acidity of the tomatoes.)</li>
    <li>Add the ground beef and sausage and increase heat to medium-high. Use a spatula to break up the meat so that it’s very fine and crumbled. Cook for 8-10 minutes, or until cooked through. Add garlic during the last minute. Drain excess grease.</li>
    <li>Add the chicken broth and use a silicone spatula to “clean” the bottom and sides of the pot. Add the marinara sauce, tomato paste, hot sauce, and Worcestershire sauce. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cover partially and let the sauce simmer gently.</li>
    <li>Preheat Oven and Cook the Lasagna Noodles</li>
    <li>Preheat oven to 375°.</li>
    <li>Begin boiling a large pot of salted pasta water for the lasagna noodles. Once a rapid boil is reached, cook the noodles to al dente according to package instructions. (Set a timer to ensure you don’t overcook them.) Gently stir with a wooden spoon throughout cooking to prevent the noodles from sticking. Drain and rinse with cold water until noodles are completely cool.</li>
    <li>Lay the cooled noodles flat on wax or parchment paper while you begin assembling the lasagna.</li>
    <li>Spread 1 heaping cup of meat sauce on the bottom of a 9 x 13-inch casserole dish. Next, add 4 lasagna noodles, overlapping them if needed.</li>
    <li>Spread 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles, followed by about 1 ½ cups of meat sauce.</li>
    <li>Top with 4 more lasagna noodles, 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture, 1 ½ cups meat sauce.</li>
    <li>Finish with 4 more lasagna noodles, the rest of the ricotta mixture, and the rest of the meat sauce.</li>
    <li>Top with 2 ½ cups of Mozzarella cheese.</li>
    <li>Bake for 45 minutes.</li>
  </ol>
